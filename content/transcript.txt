Do you know how to be a good listener? Let's see how Binky found out. This is Binky. When she's in class, she's always daydreaming. When she's with her friends, she's always talking. When she's with her teacher, she's always so fun. When she's with her best friend, he's always playing with her. And, when she's alone, she's always thinking about her friends. She wants to play with Binky while listening to music. When Binky and Bansu are together, she's always gathering attention. Always nodding listeners. Phone in the wrong direction on 1-83. The problem gets worse and worse. Uh-huh, gotcha. Passing the street, high-fiving everyone. No passing the phone in the wrong direction on 1-83. The problem gets worse and worse. One day, Binky notices something. Her friends are trying to avoid her. Every day, Binky looks for them after school, but doesn't find them anywhere. When she does find them... Hey! They say they have to go home. Binky doesn't get to play with them anymore. Binky walks home, confused. What's happening? Why are they not talking to me? Did I do something wrong? Are they trying to hide something from me? Binky thinks and thinks, but she doesn't understand. On her way, she finds Bunty. Binky tells Bunty everything. As they're passing by Mittoo's dhaba, they notice Bubloo and Jojo trying to hide from them. Binky and Bunty follow them. They reach a treehouse. Binky whispers. So, this is where they've been hiding from us? Shhh! Listen! Bunty whispers back. In the treehouse, Rani asks, What's the plan? Oh! We can get cupcakes! Bunty likes them a lot. Let's go! Bunty and Rani go to the treehouse. Oh! We can get cupcakes! Bunty likes them a lot. We can get her books. Wait! What? Everyone turns to the window. It's Bunty's birthday and you're all planning a party? Oh no! Not again! Wait a second! Why didn't you guys tell me? It's just that you sometimes... Bubloo tries to explain, but Binky cuts him off with, I what? I planned the best birthday party. Everybody knows. Yes, but... Leave it to me. I can think of what to do. Binky jumps up in excitement and paces around the room talking. I have this idea with flower garlands, candy color theme, pink, yellow, orange, or blue cakes. But Binky, we... Rani tries to interject, but stops. Wait a second! Why don't we get a rainbow cake this time? Bunty, please write all of this down. But I don't like... Bubloo, can you go find the flowers in all the colors you can get? Binky, can I? I don't want... Bubloo and Bunty look confused. Then, Binky turns to Jojo. Jojo, do you think Mithu's place will be available? That place is too crowded. It'll be fun. But Rani wasn't having it. Suddenly, she cried out. You never listen to what we want, Binky. What? I... I thought... I made all your birthdays special. You do, but planning the party is half the fun. We don't want to miss that. What? What do you mean? Binky looks like she is about to cry. Chintu walks up to Binky and says, What Rani meant to say is that you never listen, Binky. You're always daydreaming and talking non-stop. When we talk, you cut us off. You don't wait. I don't do that. I don't. See? You're cutting him off again. Rani points out. Binky turns very pink as Chintu continues. You don't try to understand what your friend is saying. You can talk, but you also need to listen. I do listen. Well, then you must know that Bunty doesn't like rainbow cakes, purple dresses, crowded places and big parties. Right? What? Who doesn't like rainbow cakes? Binky is very surprised. You would have known if you had listened, wouldn't you? I was only trying to make you happy. How was I to know what you like and what you don't? The kids look at Binky sympathetically. Chintu takes a deep breath and says, It's simple. Try not to get distracted. I don't get distracted. I just think of something and I… Pay attention to the speaker. Jojo chimes in. How? Binky asks. Well, you could look at them when they talk. Binky stands straight and looks at him. Ask questions to understand them better. Nod to let them know you understand what they mean. Chintu suggests helpfully. But what if I have something to say too? That's okay. You just have to wait for your turn to speak. So, I have to pay attention by looking at the speaker, I should wait for my turn to speak, I should nod if I understand, and ask questions if I don't. Um, I think I can do this. Okay. What do you want at your birthday party, Bunty? Bunty seems nervous as she answers. Nothing big. We can get tea and cupcakes. But that… Okay. What else? We don't have to dress up or decorate anything with flowers. We can get some balloons. We can play Ludo. We can go to the park. Sounds good. Everyone claps for Bunty and Pinky. Wasn't that difficult, was it? I think I can do it. At least I can try. This is how Pinky learned how to be a better listener and a good friend. Do you remember the tips her friends gave her?
